How to build T-gnus with Mule 2.3 based on Emacs 19.34.

FIXING loaddefs.el
==================

Unfortunately, some variables for `message' are predefined in lisp/
loaddefs.el which is dumped in Mule executable file.  It is uninvited,
moreover, it has a bad influence.  So you should remove these
definitions from lisp/loaddefs.el and rebuild Mule.  However, if you
don't want to rebuild Mule, you may put the following lines in the
beginning of .emacs file instead of rebuilding Mule.

(let ((symbols '(citation-line-function
		 cite-function courtesy-message default-headers
		 default-mail-headers default-news-headers
		 deletable-headers fcc-handler-function
		 followup-to-function from-style
		 generate-headers-first generate-new-buffers
		 ignored-bounced-headers ignored-cited-headers
		 ignored-mail-headers ignored-news-headers
		 ignored-resent-headers ignored-supersedes-headers
		 included-forward-headers indent-citation-function

		 yank-prefix))
      symbol)
  (while symbols
    (setq symbol (car symbols)
	  symbols (cdr symbol))
    (makunbound (intern (format "message-%s" symbol)))))


INSTALL CUSTOM, APEL, CLIME, SEMI
=================================

T-gnus requires the latest version of CUSTOM, APEL, CLIME and SEMI;
CLIME 1.14 provides the same features as FLIM 1.14 for old Emacsen,
which is currently available from:

ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/m17n/clime-1_14-************.tar.gz

You should install these packages before installing T-gnus.  As for
CUSTOM, you should apply the following patch before building it.

By the way, the latest CUSTOM package for Emacs v19 is available from:

ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/custom-1.9962.tar.gz


INSTALL regexp-opt.el
=====================

Some T-gnus modules use the functions `regexp-opt', etc.  That
functions are defined in regexp-opt.el(c) in the recent Emacsen,
however, Mule 2.3 does not contain it in the standard Lisp libraries.
Copy the file contrib/regexp-opt.el to site-lisp directory (or any
other directory), and byte-compile it as follows:

   % cp -p contrib/regexp-opt.el /usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp
   % cd /usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp/
   % mule -batch -q -no-site-file -f batch-byte-compile regexp-opt.el


INSTALL passwd.el
=================

This module provide the `read-passwd' function.  You have to install
it if you don't have that function.  To do this:

   % cp -p contrib/passwd.el /usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp
   % cd /usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp/
   % mule -batch -q -no-site-file -f batch-byte-compile passwd.el

And add the following line in your .emacs file:

   (autoload 'read-passwd "passwd")


INSTALL T-gnus
==============

There are three ways of making T-gnus with Mule 2.3 based on Emacs 19.34.

1. If you have installed EMU, APEL, CLIME and SEMI packages under the
   standard load-path, for instance:

   EMU:   /usr/local/share/mule/19.34/site-lisp/
   APEL:  /usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp/apel/
   CLIME: /usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp/flim/
   SEMI:  /usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp/semi/

   What is more, if you have been replaced old CUSTOM with new CUSTOM
   or if you have installed new CUSTOM directly under the standard
   load-path as such as /usr/local/share/mule/19.34/site-lisp/, you
   may have nothing to be done; type the following commands right now.

   % ./configure --with-emacs=mule
   % make install

   However, if you have installed new CUSTOM in the subdirectory under
   the standard load-path, use the configure option `--with-addpath='
   as follows:

   % ./configure --with-emacs=mule\
     --with-addpath=/usr/local/share/mule/site-lisp/custom/
   % make install

   or you can use the file subdirs.el under the parent directory of
   the subdirectory of CUSTOM to add it into load-path which contain
   the following contents:

   (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path
    '("custom/" "and the other subdirectories.../"))

   and then just type:

   % ./configure --with-emacs=mule
   % make install

2. If you have installed EMU, APEL, CLIME and SEMI packages in the
   non-standard load-path, use the configure option `--with-addpath='
   with the colon separated directory names where EMU, APEL or CUSTOM
   packages are installed.  For example:

   % ./configure --with-emacs=mule\
     --with-addpath=~/elisp/emu/:~/elisp/apel/:~/elisp/custom/
   % make install

   In this case, you have no need to add paths of CLIME, SEMI if they
   are installed under the directory which is same as the parent
   directory of APEL.

3. This is another way to install T-gnus when you have installed EMU,
   APEL, CLIME and SEMI packages in the non-standard load-path.  Copy
   the file `sample.lpath.el' which is included in the distribution to
   `~/.lpath.el' and modify it suitably for your environment.  And
   then type the following command.

   % ./configure --with-emacs=mule
   % make install


USING emacs-w3m (and Emacs/W3)
==============================
The `nnshimbun' web based back end has been moved to the emacs-w3m
package at 18 June 2003.  You need to download the latest version of
emacs-w3m if you want to browse web newspapers using T-gnus as before.
In that case, you *must* delete nnshimbun.el and nnshimbun.elc files
originated by T-gnus.  Emacs-w3m is an Emacs interface to the external
command w3m, visit the following pages for more information:

   http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/
   http://w3m.sourceforge.net/

Please give up the idea to use Emacs/W3 under Mule 2.3.  There is no
information, sorry.
