The GNOME's stock_*.png files were converted to XPM using the following GIMP
script:

;; -*- scheme -*-
;; Put this file in ~/.gimp-*/scripts/
;; gimp -i -b '(rs-save-as-xpm "foo.png" "foo.xpm" 127)'  '(gimp-quit 0)'
(define (rs-save-as-xpm filename filename2 threshold)
  (let* ((image (car (gimp-file-load RUN-NONINTERACTIVE filename filename)))
	 (drawable (car (gimp-image-get-active-layer image))))
    (file-xpm-save RUN-NONINTERACTIVE image drawable
		   filename2 filename2 threshold)
    (gimp-image-delete image)))
;; end
