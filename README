  Semi-gnus is a project that Japanese people started aiming to use
SEMI, FLIM, and APEL to improve the MIME features of Gnus.  But Gnus
caught up with and surpassed it thereafter, so it has had its day.
This repository contains a copy of the one the cvs.m17n.org CVS server
hosted till April, 2012.

  SEMI, FLIM, and APEL still live on in http://github.com/wanderlust .
