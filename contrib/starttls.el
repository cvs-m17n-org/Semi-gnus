;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements a simple wrapper around the GNU TLS command
;; line application "gnutls-cli" to make Emacs support STARTTLS.
;;
;; This package require GNUTLS 0.9.8 (released 2003-10-02) or later.
;;
;; Usage is similar to `open-network-stream', i.e.:
;;
;; (setq tmp (open-starttls-stream "test" (current-buffer) "cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu" 143))
;; #<process test<9>>
;; (process-send-string tmp ". starttls\n")
;; nil
;; (negotiate-starttls tmp)
;; "*** Starting TLS handshake
