* Changes in Oort Gnus

** message-ignored-news-headers and message-ignored-mail-headers

X-Draft-From and X-Gnus-Agent-Meta-Information have been added into
these two variables. If you customized those, perhaps you need add
those two headers too.

** Gnus reads the NOV and articles in the Agent if plugged.

If one reads an article while plugged, and the article already exists
in the Agent, it won't get downloaded once more.  (setq
gnus-agent-cache nil) reverts to the old behavior.

** Gnus supports the "format=flowed" (RFC 2646) parameter.

On composing messages, it is enabled by `use-hard-newlines'.  Decoding
format=flowed was present but not documented in earlier versions.

** Gnus supports the generation of RFC 2298 Disposition Notification requests.

This is invoked with the C-c M-n key binding from message mode.

** Gnus supports Maildir groups.

Gnus includes a new backend nnmaildir.el.

** Printing capabilities are enhanced.

Gnus supports Muttprint natively with O P from the Summary and Article
buffers.  Also, each individual MIME part can be printed using p on
the MIME button.

** Message supports the Importance: header.

In the message buffer, C-c C-f C-i or C-u cycles through the valid values.

** Gnus supports Cancel Locks in News.

This means a header "Cancel-Lock" is inserted in news posting. It is
used to determine if you wrote a article or not (for
cancelling/superseding).  The behaviour can be changed by customizing
`message-insert-canlock'.

** Gnus supports server-side mail filtering using Sieve.

Sieve rules can be added as Group Parameters for groups, and the
complete Sieve script is generated using `D g' from the Group buffer,
and then uploaded to the server using `C-c C-l' in the generated Sieve
buffer.  Search the online Gnus manual for "sieve", and see the new
Sieve manual, for more information.

** Extended format specs.

Format spec "%&user-date;" is added into
gnus-summary-line-format-alist.  Also, user defined extended format
specs are supported.  The extended format specs look like "%u&foo;",
which invokes function gnus-user-format-function-foo.  Because "&" is
used as the escape character, old user defined format "%u&" is no
longer supported.

** `/ *' (gnus-summary-limit-include-cached) is rewritten.

It was aliased to `Y c' (gnus-summary-insert-cached-articles). The new
function filters out other articles.

** Group names are treated as UTF-8 by default.

This is supposedly what USEFOR wants to migrate to.  See
`gnus-group-name-charset-group-alist' and
`gnus-group-name-charset-method-alist' for customization.

** The nnml and nnfolder backends store marks for each groups.

This makes it possible to take backup of nnml/nnfolder servers/groups
separately of .newsrc.eld, while preserving marks.  It also makes it
possible to share articles and marks between users (without sharing
the .newsrc.eld file) within e.g. a department.  It works by storing
the marks stored in .newsrc.eld in a per-group file ".marks" (for
nnml) and "groupname.mrk" (for nnfolder, named "groupname").  If the
nnml/nnfolder is moved to another machine, Gnus will automatically use
the .marks or .mrk file instead of the information in .newsrc.eld.
The new server variables `nnml-marks-is-evil' and
`nnfolder-marks-is-evil' can be used to disable this feature.

** The menu bar (in Group and Summary buffer) named "Misc" has been
renamed to "Gnus".

** The menu bar (in Message mode) named "MML" has been renamed to
"Attachments".

** gnus-group-charset-alist and gnus-group-ignored-charsets-alist.

The regexps in these variables are compared with full group names
instead of real group names in 5.8.  Users who customize these
variables should change those regexps accordingly. For example:

   ("^han\\>" euc-kr) -> ("\\(^\\|:\\)han\\>" euc-kr)

** Gnus supports PGP (RFC 1991/2440), PGP-MIME (RFC 2015/3156) and
SMIME.

** Gnus inlines external parts (message/external).

** MML (Mime compose) prefix changed from `M-m' to `C-c C-m'.

This change was made to avoid conflict with the standard binding of
`back-to-indentation', which is also useful in message mode.


* Changes in Pterodactyl Gnus (5.8/5.9)

The Gnus NEWS entries are short, but they reflect sweeping changes in
four areas: Article display treatment, MIME treatment,
internationalization and mail-fetching.

** The mail-fetching functions have changed.  See the manual for the
many details.  In particular, all procmail fetching variables are gone.

If you used procmail like in

(setq nnmail-use-procmail t)
(setq nnmail-spool-file 'procmail)
(setq nnmail-procmail-directory "~/mail/incoming/")
(setq nnmail-procmail-suffix "\\.in")

this now has changed to 

(setq mail-sources
      '((directory :path "~/mail/incoming/"
		   :suffix ".in")))

More information is available in the info doc at Select Methods ->
Getting Mail -> Mail Sources

** Gnus is now a MIME-capable reader.  This affects many parts of
Gnus, and adds a slew of new commands.  See the manual for details.

** Gnus has also been multilingualized.  This also affects too
many parts of Gnus to summarize here, and adds many new variables.

** gnus-auto-select-first can now be a function to be
called to position point.

** The user can now decide which extra headers should be included in
summary buffers and NOV files.

** `gnus-article-display-hook' has been removed.  Instead, a number
of variables starting with `gnus-treat-' have been added.

** The Gnus posting styles have been redone again and now works in a
subtly different manner.

** New web-based backends have been added: nnslashdot, nnwarchive
and nnultimate.  nnweb has been revamped, again, to keep up with
ever-changing layouts.

** Gnus can now read IMAP mail via nnimap.
