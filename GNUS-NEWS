* Changes in No Gnus

** Upgrading from previous (stable) version if you have used No Gnus.

If you have tried No Gnus (the unstable Gnus branch leading to this
release) but went back to a stable version, be careful when upgrading
to this version.  In particular, you will probably want to remove the
`~/News/marks' directory (perhaps selectively), so that flags are
read from your `~/.newsrc.eld' instead of from the stale marks file,
where this release will store flags for nntp.  See a later entry for
more information about nntp marks.  Note that downgrading isn't safe
in general.

** The nntp back end stores article marks in `~/News/marks'.

The directory can be changed using the (customizable) variable
`nntp-marks-directory', and marks can be disabled using the (back
end) variable `nntp-marks-is-evil'.  The advantage of this is that
you can copy `~/News/marks' (using rsync, scp or whatever) to another
Gnus installation, and it will realize what articles you have read
and marked.  The data in `~/News/marks' has priority over the same
data in `~/.newsrc.eld'.

** Picons can be displayed right from the textual address, see
`gnus-picon-style'.  *Note Picons::.

** You can import and export your RSS subscriptions from OPML files.
*Note RSS::.

** The option `mm-fill-flowed' can be used to disable treatment of
format=flowed messages.  Also, flowed text is disabled when sending
inline PGP signed messages.

** You can now drag and drop attachments to the Message buffer.  See
`mml-dnd-protocol-alist' and `mml-dnd-attach-options'.  *Note MIME:
(message)MIME.

** The option `message-yank-empty-prefix' now controls how empty lines
are prefixed in cited text.  *Note Insertion Variables:
(message)Insertion Variables.

** ANSI SGR control sequences can be transformed using `W A'.

ANSI sequences are used in some Chinese hierarchies for highlighting
articles (`gnus-article-treat-ansi-sequences').

** International host names (IDNA) can now be decoded inside article
bodies using `W i' (`gnus-summary-idna-message').  This requires that
GNU Libidn (`http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/') has been installed.

** Gnus includes an Emacs Lisp SASL library.

This provides a clean API to SASL mechanisms from within Emacs.  The
user visible aspects of this, compared to the earlier situation,
include support for DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM.

** ManageSieve connections uses the SASL library by default.

The primary change this brings is support for DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM,
when the server supports it.

** Gnus includes a password cache mechanism in password.el.

It is enabled by default (see `password-cache'), with a short timeout
of 16 seconds (see `password-cache-expiry').  If PGG is used as the
PGP back end, the PGP passphrase is managed by this mechanism.
Passwords for ManageSieve connections are managed by this mechanism,
after querying the user about whether to do so.

** IMAP identity (RFC 2971) is supported.

By default, Gnus does not send any information about itself, but you
can customize it using the variable `nnimap-id'.

** The `all.SCORE' file can be edited from the group buffer using `W e'.

** Gnus now MIME decodes articles even when they lack "MIME-Version"
header.  This changes the default of `gnus-article-loose-mime'.

** Gnus now views DNS master files sent as text/dns using dns-mode.

** Gnus now support the "hashcash" client puzzle anti-spam idea.  See
the Gnus manual, section Hashcash, for more information.  Use `(setq
message-generate-hashcash t)' to enable.

** Gnus supports new limiting commands in the Summary buffer: `/ r'
(`gnus-summary-limit-to-replied') and `/ R'
(`gnus-summary-limit-to-recipient').  *Note Limiting::.

** Gnus supports a new sort command in the Summary buffer: `C-c C-s C-t'
(`gnus-summary-sort-by-recipient').  *Note Summary Sorting::.

** The `nnrss' back end now supports multilingual text.  Non-ASCII group
names for the `nnrss' groups are also supported.  *Note RSS::.

** URLs inside OpenPGP: headers are retrieved and imported to your PGP
key ring when you click on them.

** Gnus uses narrowing to hide headers in Message buffers.  The
`References' header is hidden by default.  To make all headers
visible, use `(setq message-hidden-headers nil)'.

** `gnus-decay-scores' can be a regexp matching score files.  For
example, set it to `\\.ADAPT\\'' and only adaptive score files will
be decayed.  *Note Score Decays::.

** S/MIME now features LDAP user certificate searches.  You need to
configure the server in `smime-ldap-host-list'.

** Strings prefixing to the `To' and `Newsgroup' headers in summary
lines when using `gnus-ignored-from-addresses' can be customized with
`gnus-summary-to-prefix' and `gnus-summary-newsgroup-prefix'.  *Note
To From Newsgroups::.

** You can replace MIME parts with external bodies.  See
`gnus-mime-replace-part' and `gnus-article-replace-part'.  *Note MIME
Commands::, *Note Using MIME::.

** Lisp files are now installed in .../site-lisp/gnus/ by default.  It
defaulted to .../site-lisp/ formerly.  In addition to this, the new
installer issues a warning if other Gnus installations which will
shadow the latest one are detected.  You can then remove those shadows
manually or remove them using `make remove-installed-shadows'.

** Retrieving mail with POP3 is supported over SSL/TLS and with StartTLS.

** Having edited the select-method for the foreign server in the server
buffer is immediately reflected to the subscription of the groups
which use the server in question.  For instance, if you change
`nntp-via-address' into `bar.example.com' from `foo.example.com',
Gnus will connect to the news host by way of the intermediate host
`bar.example.com' from next time.

** You can change the location of XEmacs' toolbars in Gnus buffers.  See
`gnus-use-toolbar' and `message-use-toolbar'.
