* Changes in No Gnus

** Gnus includes an Emacs Lisp SASL library.

This provide a clean API to SASL mechanisms from within Emacs.  The
user visible aspects of this, compared to the earlier situation,
include support for DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM.

** ManageSieve connections uses the SASL library by default.

The primary change this brings is support for DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM,
when the server support it.

** Gnus include a password cache mechanism in password.el.

It is enabled by default (see `password-cache'), with a short timeout
of 16 seconds (see `password-cache-expiry').  If PGG is used as the
PGP backend, the PGP passphrase is managed by this mechanism.
Passwords for ManageSieve connections are managed by this mechanism,
after quering the user about whether to do so.

** IMAP identity (RFC 2971) is supported.

By default, Gnus do not send any information about itself, but you can
customize it via the variable `nnimap-id'.

** The "all.SCORE" file can now be edited from the group buffer using `W e'.

** The prompt for creating new groups (`G m') now auto complete known groups.
