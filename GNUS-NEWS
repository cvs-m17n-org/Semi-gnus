** Gnus changes.

*** The Gnus distribution no longer bundles Custom and Widget.
If your Emacs doesn't come with these libraries, fetch them from
<URL:http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/>.  You also then need to
add the following to the lisp/dgnushack.el file:

     (push "~/lisp/custom" load-path)

Modify to suit your needs.

*** New functionality for using Gnus as an offline newsreader has been
added.  A plethora of new commands and modes have been added.  See the
Gnus manual for the full story.

*** The nndraft backend has returned, but works differently than
before.  All Message buffers are now also articles in the nndraft
group, which is created automatically.

*** `gnus-alter-header-function' can now be used to alter header
values.

*** `gnus-summary-goto-article' now accept Message-ID's.

*** A new Message command for deleting text in the body of a message
outside the region: `C-c C-v'.

*** You can now post to component group in nnvirtual groups with
`C-u C-c C-c'.

*** `nntp-rlogin-program' -- new variable to ease customization.

*** `C-u C-c C-c' in `gnus-article-edit-mode' will now inhibit
re-highlighting of the article buffer.

*** New element in `gnus-boring-article-headers' -- `long-to'.

*** `M-i' symbolic prefix command.  See the section "Symbolic
Prefixes" in the Gnus manual for details.

*** `L' and `I' in the summary buffer now take the symbolic prefix
`a' to add the score rule to the "all.SCORE" file.

*** `gnus-simplify-subject-functions' variable to allow greater
control over simplification.

*** `A T' -- new command for fetching the current thread.

*** `/ T' -- new command for including the current thread in the
limit.

*** `M-RET' is a new Message command for breaking cited text.

*** \\1-expressions are now valid in `nnmail-split-methods'.

*** The `custom-face-lookup' function has been removed.  
If you used this function in your initialization files, you must
rewrite them to use `face-spec-set' instead.

*** Cancelling now uses the current select method.  Symbolic prefix
`a' forces normal posting method.

*** New command to translate M******** sm*rtq**t*s into proper text
-- `W d'.

*** For easier debugging of nntp, you can set `nntp-record-commands'
to a non-nil value.

*** nntp now uses ~/.authinfo, a .netrc-like file, for controlling
where and how to send AUTHINFO to NNTP servers.

*** A command for editing group parameters from the summary buffer
has been added.

*** A history of where mails have been split is available.

*** A new article date command has been added -- `article-date-iso8601'.

*** Subjects can be simplified when threading by setting
`gnus-score-thread-simplify'.

*** A new function for citing in Message has been added --
`message-cite-original-without-signature'.

*** `article-strip-all-blank-lines' -- new article command.

*** A new Message command to kill to the end of the article has
been added.

*** A minimum adaptive score can be specified by using the
`gnus-adaptive-word-minimum' variable.

*** The "lapsed date" article header can be kept continually
updated by the `gnus-start-date-timer' command.

*** Web listserv archives can be read with the nnlistserv backend.

*** Old dejanews archives can now be read by nnweb.

*** Byte-compilation of user-specs now works under XEmacs.

*** `gnus-posting-styles' has been re-activated.
