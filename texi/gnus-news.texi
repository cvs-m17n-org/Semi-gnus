This file contains a list of news features Gnus.  It is supposed to be
included in `gnus.texi'.  `GNUS-NEWS' is automatically generated from
this file (see `gnus-news.el').

@itemize @bullet

@item @kbd{/ r} limits the summary buffer to replied articles.

@item @acronym{ANSI} @acronym{SGR} control sequences can be transformed
using @kbd{W A}.

@acronym{ANSI} sequences are used in some Chinese hierarchies for
highlighting articles (@code{gnus-article-treat-ansi-sequences}).

@item Gnus includes an Emacs Lisp @acronym{SASL} library.

This provide a clean @acronym{API} to @acronym{SASL} mechanisms from
within Emacs.  The user visible aspects of this, compared to the earlier
situation, include support for @acronym{DIGEST}-@acronym{MD5} and
@acronym{NTLM}.

@item ManageSieve connections uses the @acronym{SASL} library by default.

The primary change this brings is support for @acronym{DIGEST-MD5} and
@acronym{NTLM}, when the server support it.

@item Gnus include a password cache mechanism in password.el.

It is enabled by default (see @code{password-cache}), with a short
timeout of 16 seconds (see @code{password-cache-expiry}).  If
@acronym{PGG} is used as the @acronym{PGP} backend, the @acronym{PGP}
passphrase is managed by this mechanism.  Passwords for ManageSieve
connections are managed by this mechanism, after quering the user about
whether to do so.

@item @acronym{IMAP} identity (@acronym{RFC} 2971) is supported.

By default, Gnus do not send any information about itself, but you can
customize it using @code{nnimap-id}.

@item The @file{all.SCORE} file can now be edited from the group buffer 
using @kbd{W e}.

@end itemize

@c gnus-news.texi ends here.
